# auto-join-zoom-meeting

This script logins to school's online platform and joins zoom classes on time set by the user.\
It also sends an email to the specified mail address if the attempt to join zoom meeting fails.\
Obviously this will only work for the website that is set to 'url' variable by me but you can implement something similar for your platform by copying and tweaking the code.

-You need "chromedriver.exe" to be in the same directory as the "autoJoin.py" file.\
-You must install necessary libraries using pip.\
-You can use your own .env file or just hard code all the necessary fields in the script such as username, password, senderMail etc.
